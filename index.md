## About Me

Hi, I'm Nitya! I'm a junior studying Mechanical Engineering at Cornell University. I'm passionate about exploring robotics and controls, both from a theoretical and application point of view. I'm interested in learning about the interface of physical and mechanical systems with electrical integration. I'm proficient in 3D Modeling, Simulation Analysis, and industry standard technologies like Python, Autodesk Fusion 360 and prototyping skills like operating an automatic CNC machine and utilizing a engine lathe. I have a number of prominent roles from Mechanical Design Lead on my project team to Mechanical Engineering Intern at a startup.
