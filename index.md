## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile-pic.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
Hi, I am Nitya, a junior at Cornell University studying Mechanical Engineering, with a focus on robotics and controls. I’m fascinated by the intersection of mechanical and electrical systems and enjoy applying both theory and hands-on design to real-world projects. I have experience with 3D modeling, simulation analysis, and tools like MATLAB and Autodesk Fusion 360. I have served as Mechanical Design Lead on my project team, Cornell AutoBoat, and as a Mechanical Engineering Intern at a startup, aRoboticsCompany (aRC), contributing to projects from concept to implementation. I am passionate about tackling challenges in robotics, automation, and system integration, and I enjoy developing solutions that combine design, innovation, and functionality.
