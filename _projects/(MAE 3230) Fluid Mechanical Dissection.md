**Overview:**
This project involved a fluid-mechanical dissection of an accordion to analyze its internal components and airflow behavior. The primary elements examined included the bellows, reed blocks, valve assemblies, and endplates. Sound production occurs as air flows through the instrument, causing reeds at various locations to oscillate at specific frequencies corresponding to musical notes. Compression and expansion of the bellows generate a pressure differential that drives airflow through the reed blocks. To support this analysis, a detailed CAD model of the dissected accordion was developed to visualize the internal arrangement and airflow paths within the device.
